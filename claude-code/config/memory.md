# Manage Claude's memory - Settings - Terminal configuration - Model configuration - Memory management - Status line configuration - Determine memory type - CLAUDE.md imports - How Claude looks up memories - Directly edit memories with /memory - Set up project memory - Modular rules with .claude/rules/ - Basic structure - Path-specific rules - Glob patterns - Subdirectories - Symlinks - User-level rules - Organization-level memory management - Memory best practices # Manage Claude's memory Learn how to manage Claude Code’s memory across sessions with different memory locations and best practices. ## ​Determine memory type `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/CLAUDE.md``/etc/claude-code/CLAUDE.md``C:\Program Files\ClaudeCode\CLAUDE.md``./CLAUDE.md``./.claude/CLAUDE.md``./.claude/rules/*.md``~/.claude/CLAUDE.md``./CLAUDE.local.md` ## ​CLAUDE.md imports `@path/to/import` ``` See @README for project overview and @package.json for available npm commands for this project. # Additional Instructions - git workflow @docs/git-instructions.md ``` ``` # Individual Preferences - @~/.claude/my-project-instructions.md ``` ``` This code span will not be treated as an import: `@anthropic-ai/claude-code` ``` `/memory` ## ​How Claude looks up memories ## ​Directly edit memories with/memory `/memory``/memory` ## ​Set up project memory `./CLAUDE.md``./.claude/CLAUDE.md` ``` > /init ``` - Include frequently used commands (build, test, lint) to avoid repeated searches - Document code style preferences and naming conventions - Add important architectural patterns specific to your project - CLAUDE.md memories can be used for both instructions shared with your team and for your individual preferences. ## ​Modular rules with.claude/rules/ `.claude/rules/``.claude/rules/` ### ​Basic structure `.claude/rules/` ``` your-project/ ├── .claude/ │ ├── CLAUDE.md # Main project instructions │ └── rules/ │ ├── code-style.md # Code style guidelines │ ├── testing.md # Testing conventions │ └── security.md # Security requirements ``` `.md``.claude/rules/``.claude/CLAUDE.md` ### ​Path-specific rules `paths` ``` --- paths: src/api/**/*.ts --- # API Development Rules - All API endpoints must include input validation - Use the standard error response format - Include OpenAPI documentation comments ``` `paths` ### ​Glob patterns `paths``**/*.ts``src/**/*``src/``*.md``src/components/*.tsx` ``` --- paths: src/**/*.{ts,tsx} --- # TypeScript/React Rules ``` `src/**/*.ts``src/**/*.tsx` ``` --- paths: {src,lib}/**/*.ts, tests/**/*.test.ts --- ``` ### ​Subdirectories ``` .claude/rules/ ├── frontend/ │ ├── react.md │ └── styles.md ├── backend/ │ ├── api.md │ └── database.md └── general.md ``` `.md` ### ​Symlinks `.claude/rules/` ``` # Symlink a shared rules directory ln -s ~/shared-claude-rules .claude/rules/shared # Symlink individual rule files ln -s ~/company-standards/security.md .claude/rules/security.md ``` ### ​User-level rules `~/.claude/rules/` ``` ~/.claude/rules/ ├── preferences.md # Your personal coding preferences └── workflows.md # Your preferred workflows ``` `.claude/rules/`- Keep rules focused: Each file should cover one topic (e.g.,testing.md,api-design.md) - Use descriptive filenames: The filename should indicate what the rules cover - Use conditional rules sparingly: Only addpathsfrontmatter when rules truly apply to specific file types - Organize with subdirectories: Group related rules (e.g.,frontend/,backend/) `testing.md``api-design.md``paths``frontend/``backend/` ## ​Organization-level memory management 1. Create the enterprise memory file at theEnterprise policylocation shown in thememory types table above. 2. Deploy via your configuration management system (MDM, Group Policy, Ansible, etc.) to ensure consistent distribution across all developer machines. ## ​Memory best practices - Be specific: “Use 2-space indentation” is better than “Format code properly”. - Use structure to organize: Format each individual memory as a bullet point and group related memories under descriptive markdown headings. - Review periodically: Update memories as your project evolves to ensure Claude is always using the most up to date information and context.
